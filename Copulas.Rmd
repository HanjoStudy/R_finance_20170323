# Introduction

* In the past session, you have encountered a vast array of financial models
    + Basic ARIMA models for the mean equation
    + GARCH extensions to deal with heteroscedasticity
    + Multivariate GARCH models that deal with dependence modeling
* Theoretical problem arises when we talk about __dependence__
    + Capturing co-movement between financial asset returns with linear correlation has been the staple approach in modern finance since the birth of Harry Markowitz's portfolio theory 
    + But linear correlation is only appropriate when the dependence structure (or joint distribution) follow a normal distribution
* Enter copulas - flexible framework to model general multivariate dependence

# Goal

* Grasp basic concepts and generators within the field of copulas
    + Learn to walk, before we can run
    + Revisit your statistics
* Understand the field of copulas to such an extent that you might go on to do a PhD in this field ;-)

# Fields where copulas are applied
* Quantitative finance
    * Stress-tests and robustness checks 
    * "Downside/crisis/panic regimes" where extreme downside events are important
    * Pool of asset evaluation
    * Latest development: Vine Copulas

# Introduction to copulas

* Copula stems from the latin verb copulare; bond or tie.
    * Regulated financial institutions are under pressure to build robust internal models to account for risk exposure
    * Fundamental ideology of these internal models rely on joint dependency among whole basket of mixed instruments
    * This issue can be addresed through the copula instrument
    * It functions as a linking mechanism between uniform marginals through the inverse cdf
* Copula theory was first developed by Sklar in 1959 @nelsen2007introduction.

# Introduction to copulas (Sklar)
* Sklar's theorem forms the basis for copula models as:
    * It does not require identical marginal distributions and allows for n-dimensional expansion
* Let $X$ be a random variable with marginal cumulative distribution function:
    + $F_X(x) = \mathcal{P}(X \leq x)$
    + Probability that random variable $X$ takes on a value less or equal to point of evaluation
    + $F_X(x) \sim U(0,1)$
    
# Introduction to copulas (Sklar cont.)
* If we now denote the inverse CDF (Quantile funtion) as $F_x^{-1}$
    + $U \sim U(0,1)$ then $F_x^{-1}(U) \sim F(X)$
* This allows a simple way for us to simulate observations from the $F_X$ provided the inverse cdf, $F_X^{-1}$ is easy to calculate
* Think, median is $F_X^{-1}(0.5)$

Lets have a look visually

# Definitions and basic properties
* Define the uniform distribution on an interval $(0,1)$ by $U(0,1)$, i.e the probability of a random variable $U$ satisfying $P(U \leq u) = u$ for $u \in (0,1)$
    * This is the quantile function $(Q = F^{-1})$
Probability transformation implies that if $X$ has a distribution function $F$, then $F(X) \sim U(0,1)$ iff $F$ is continous


# Definitions and basic properties (cont)
__Definition (Copula):__ A d-dimensional copula is the distrubutiom function $\mathcal{C}$ of a random vector $U$ whose components $U_k$ are uniformly distributed
\vspace{-2cm}
  \begin{align}
C(u_1, \ldots, u_d) = P(U_1 \leq u_1, \ldots, U_d \leq u_d), (u_1, \ldots, u_d) \in (0,1)^d
\end{align}
\vspace{-1.5cm}
Thus Sklar's theorem states:
\vspace{-1.5cm}
  \begin{align}
C(F_1(x_1), \ldots,F_d(x_d)) &= P(U_1 \leq F_1(x_1), \ldots, U_d \leq F_d(x_d))\notag\\
                             &= P(F_1^{-1}(U_1) \leq x_1, \ldots, F_d^{-1}(U_d) \leq x_d)\notag\\
                             &= F(x_1, \ldots, x_d)
\end{align}

#Joint distribution function:

* This represents the joint distribution function function $F$ can be expressed in terms of a copula $C$ and the marginal distristributions $(F_1, \ldots, F_d)$. Modeling them seperately

* __Easy Def:__ A Copula is a function that couples the joint distribution function to its univariate marginal distribution

* Dependence or correlation coefficient dependent on marginal distributions. This one to one mapping of correlation and dependece only works in case of elliptical joint distribution
* For copulas, we use Kendall's Tau - non-linear concordance measure

# Kendall's Tau
* Let $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$ be i.i.d random vectors, each with joint distribution function $H$

* Tau is then defined as the probability of concordance minus the probability of discordance
\vspace{-1.5cm}
  \begin{align}
\tau = \tau_{X,Y} = P((X_1 - X_2)(Y_1 - Y_2) > 0) - P((X_1 - X_2) - (Y_1 - Y_2) < 0)
\end{align}
\vspace{-1.5cm}
* Tau is the difference between the probability that the observed data are in the same order versus the probability that the observed data are no in the same order


<!-- # Meeting the generator -->

<!-- The Gaussian copula $C_p^{Ga}$ is a distribution over the unit cube $[0,1]^{d}$. This represents a linear correlation matrix $\rho$. $C_p^{Ga}$ is defined as the distribution function of a random vector $(\psi(X_1),\ldots, \psi(X_d))$, where $\psi$ is the univariate standard normal distribution function where $X \sim, N_d(0,\rho)$ -->
<!-- \vspace{-2cm} -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!-- C_p^{Ga}=\Phi _{R}\left(\Phi ^{-1}(u_{1}),\dots ,\Phi ^{-1}(u_{d})\right) -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!-- \vspace{-1.5cm} -->
<!-- where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and $\Phi_{R}$ is the joint cumulative distribution -->

<!-- # Student T Copula -->

<!-- The student's t-copula $C_{\upsilon,\rho}^t$ of $d$-dimension can be characterised by parameter $\upsilon\geq0$ degrees of freedom and linear correlation matrix $\rho$. The random vector $X$ has a $t^d(0,\rho\upsilon)$ distribution with univariate function -->
<!-- \vspace{-1.5cm} -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!-- C_{\upsilon,\rho}^t &= \mathcal{P}(t_\upsilon(X_1)\leq(u_1), \ldots, t_\upsilon(X_d)\leq u_d)\\ -->
<!--                     &=t_{\upsilon,\rho}^d(t_{\upsilon}^{-1}(u_1),\ldots, t_\upsilon^{-1}(u_d)) -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- # Archimedean Copulas -->
<!-- * Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula (Guassian dont) -->
<!--     * Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence high dimensions -->
<!--     * Does this with only one only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence. -->

# Vine-Copulas
* A vine is a graphical tool for labeling constraints in high-dimensional probability distributions
* Regular Vines from part of what is know as pair copula construction
* Trees are constructed between copulas based on what is know as maximum spanning degree (Or concordance measure)

* Under suitable differentiability conditions, any multivariate density $F_{1\ldots n}$ on $n$ variables may be represented in closed form as a product of univariate densities and (conditional) copula densities on any R-vine $V$

# Vine copulas kurowicka2006

The R-vine copula density is uniquely identified according to Theorom 4.2 of @kurowicka2006:
\vspace{-1.5cm}
\begin{align}
  c(F_1(x_1),\cdots, F_d(x_d)) = \prod_{i=1}^{d-1}\prod_{e\in E_i}c_{j(e),k(e)|D(e)}\left(F(x_{j(e)}|\mathbf{x}_{D(e)})\right)
  \label{r_vine_eq}
\end{align}

# Different structures

Vine copula specifications are base upon graph theory and more so Vines.

* This gives a lot of scope for the structure of the arrangement of assets
* R-vine, D-Vine, C-Vine

# D-Vine, C-Vine and R-Vine

Each of the structures provide their own insight into the dynamics of the market
