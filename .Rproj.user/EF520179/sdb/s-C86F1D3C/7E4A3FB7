bond or tie.\n    * Regulated financial institutions are under pressure to build robust internal models to account for risk exposure\n    * Fundamental ideology of these internal models rely on joint dependency among whole basket of mixed instruments\n    * This issue can be addresed through the copula instrument\n    * It functions as a linking mechanism between uniform marginals through the inverse cdf\n* Copula theory was first developed by Sklar in 1959 @nelsen2007introduction.\n\n# Introduction to copulas (Sklar)\n* Sklar's theorem forms the basis for copula models as:\n    * It does not require identical marginal distributions and allows for n-dimensional expansion\n* Let $X$ be a random variable with marginal cumulative distribution function:\n    + $F_X(x) = \\mathcal{P}(X \\leq x)$\n    + Probability that random variable $X$ takes on a value less or equal to point of evaluation\n    + $F_X(x) \\sim U(0,1)$\n    \n# Introduction to copulas (Sklar cont.)\n* If we now denote the inverse CDF (Quantile funtion) as $F_x^{-1}$\n    + $U \\sim U(0,1)$ then $F_x^{-1}(U) \\sim F(X)$\n* This allows a simple way for us to simulate observations from the $F_X$ provided the inverse cdf, $F_X^{-1}$ is easy to calculate\n* Think, median is $F_X^{-1}(0.5)$\n\nLets have a look visually\n\n# Definitions and basic properties\n* Define the uniform distribution on an interval $(0,1)$ by $U(0,1)$, i.e the probability of a random variable $U$ satisfying $P(U \\leq u) = u$ for $u \\in (0,1)$\n    * This is the quantile function $(Q = F^{-1})$\nProbability transformation implies that if $X$ has a distribution function $F$, then $F(X) \\sim U(0,1)$ iff $F$ is continous\n\n\n# Definitions and basic properties (cont)\n__Definition (Copula):__ A d-dimensional copula is the distrubutiom function $\\mathcal{C}$ of a random vector $U$ whose components $U_k$ are uniformly distributed\n\\vspace{-2cm}\n  \\begin{align}\nC(u_1, \\ldots, u_d) = P(U_1 \\leq u_1, \\ldots, U_d \\leq u_d), (u_1, \\ldots, u_d) \\in (0,1)^d\n\\end{align}\n\\vspace{-1.5cm}\nThus Sklar's theorem states:\n\\vspace{-1.5cm}\n  \\begin{align}\nC(F_1(x_1), \\ldots,F_d(x_d)) &= P(U_1 \\leq F_1(x_1), \\ldots, U_d \\leq F_d(x_d))\\notag\\\\\n                             &= P(F_1^{-1}(U_1) \\leq x_1, \\ldots, F_d^{-1}(U_d) \\leq x_d)\\notag\\\\\n                             &= F(x_1, \\ldots, x_d)\n\\end{align}\n\n#Joint distribution function:\n\n* This represents the joint distribution function function $F$ can be expressed in terms of a copula $C$ and the marginal distristributions $(F_1, \\ldots, F_d)$. Modeling them seperately\n\n* __Easy Def:__ A Copula is a function that couples the joint distribution function to its univariate marginal distribution\n\n* Dependence or correlation coefficient dependent on marginal distributions. This one to one mapping of correlation and dependece only works in case of elliptical joint distribution\n* For copulas, we use Kendall's Tau - non-linear concordance measure\n\n# Kendall's Tau\n* Let $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$ be i.i.d random vectors, each with joint distribution function $H$\n\n* Tau is then defined as the probability of concordance minus the probability of discordance\n\\vspace{-1.5cm}\n  \\begin{align}\n\\tau = \\tau_{X,Y} = P((X_1 - X_2)(Y_1 - Y_2) > 0) - P((X_1 - X_2) - (Y_1 - Y_2) < 0)\n\\end{align}\n\\vspace{-1.5cm}\n* Tau is the difference between the probability that the observed data are in the same order versus the probability that the observed data are no in the same order\n\n\n<!-- # Meeting the generator -->\n\n<!-- The Gaussian copula $C_p^{Ga}$ is a distribution over the unit cube $[0,1]^{d}$.
